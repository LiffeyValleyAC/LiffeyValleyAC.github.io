For adding new images to the carousel, paste the photo file here (LiffeyValleyAC.github.io\assets\images\carousel).
Crop the image to an aspect ratio of 11:3 (example 1170x320)
In index.html, add the file name:

const carouselImages = [
    {
      src: '/assets/images/carousel/dublin-senior-xc-women-team.jpeg',
      alt: "Our women\'s team at the Dublin Novice Cross Country"
    },

That's it ;-)
