This Sunday just gone Liffey Valley were out in force marshalling the 37th Women's 
Mini-Marathon. With over 30000 entrants it is billed by the organisers as the biggest
event of its kind in the world. Liffey Valley club members were stationed from Sandymount
Avenue to the finish and so were on-hand to provide help and encouragement
to the runners as they neared the end of the hard slog. 

Congratulations to all the runners and we look forward to seeing you all making the superb 
physical and charitable efforts again next year.
