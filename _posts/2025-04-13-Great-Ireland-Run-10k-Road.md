location: Phoenix Park, Co. Dublin.

Well done to all of our athletes who ran at the Great Ireland Run in the Phoenix Park with a beautiful weather.

Congratuations to <b>Mollie O'Donell</b> who finished 1st woman and claimed an Individual GoldðŸ¥‡. She dedicated her win to her late coach Nick Davis, and itâ€™s safe to say it was a truly fitting tribute to a man who gave so much to the sport and our club.
