Tonight, we presented an Honorary Life Membership of Liffey Valley Athletics Club Award to Nick Davis to officially recognise the long-term commitment, dedication, support and the significant contribution that Nick has made to LVAC over the years – Nick has been central and at the heart of many of the athletics success the club has had over the years.

While many of us know the many achievements that Nick has had as an athlete and also with the club and indeed nationally and internationally, we would like to highlight a few:

<b>Nick as an Athlete<b/>

Nick started his athletic career with South Dublin Harriers where his main events were 200 and 400 meters and he medalled in the Leinster Senior championships over 200 metres.

He also has the unusual claim to fame for a sprinter to have also won Dublin and Leinster Medals over the cross country when he was part of the Avondale team that won the Leinster Intermediate. He also ran one marathon.

<b>Nick as a Coach<b/>

Nick  is a founding member of Liffey Valley and was appointed club coach upon the club’s inception.

The club had immediate success and won many team titles at Regional and National Senior Level 

In the club’s first year he also coached Tom Brennan to win the National Senior Male Cross Country championships

He also coached Kathryn Davis to win the Women’s National Senior title during those years.

When the club revived the Women’s section in the early 2000's, Nick became coach and we have enjoyed many successes at Dublin, Leinster & National Level since then.

<b>Athletics Ireland<b/>

Nick is a founding member of the Athletics Association of Ireland in 1999 and was elected it's first President upon its inception. 

Nick has also been a council member of European Athletics for over 30 years and has attended meetings throughout Europe in that role.
