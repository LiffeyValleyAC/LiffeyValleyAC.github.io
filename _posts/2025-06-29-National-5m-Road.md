<p><strong>Thank you and congratulations to everyone who took part in the Irish Runner 5 Mile in Phoenix Park on Sunday, June 29th, 2025.</strong></p>

<p>It was a clear and pleasant summer morning, a great setting for the second race in the 2025 Athletics Ireland Race Series. We saw many strong performances and consistent efforts across the board.</p>

<p><strong>Congratulations to Lynn Devitt and Pat Collins</strong> on earning silver medals in their respective age categories.</p>

<p>Our men’s team placed with solid results in the <strong>Senior Team (5th)</strong>, <strong>Over 35 (9th)</strong>, and <strong>Over 50 (8th)</strong> team categories.</p>

<p>Our women's team placed <strong>4th overall</strong> and <strong>4th Over 35 </strong>

<p>There were also a number of new personal bests, which reflect the steady progress being made within the group. Well done to all involved.</p>

<p>Let’s continue building on this performance in the upcoming races.</p>
