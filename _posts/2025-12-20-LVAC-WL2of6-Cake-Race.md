  We enjoyed another <strong>excellent edition of the Cake Race 2025</strong> (the second race in our Club Winter League), with a fantastic
  turnout of <strong>41 athletes</strong> taking part. As always, the handicapped format delivered
  an exciting and competitive race, featuring a <strong>tight finish</strong> and plenty of
  in race rivalries throughout the field.

  <strong>Brigid claimed the win</strong> with a strong and well-timed run, followed closely by
  <strong>Niki Lynch in second place</strong> and <strong>Luke Evans taking third</strong>, making it
  a thrilling podium battle.

  Well done to <strong>all our athletes</strong> for their great efforts, and a
  <strong>big thank you to our officials</strong> for ensuring another successful and enjoyable event.
