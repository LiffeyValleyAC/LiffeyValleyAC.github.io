location: Dog Pond, Phoenix Park, Dublin

Thank you to everyone who took part in the first of six races in the <b>Liffey Valley AC Winter League 2025–2026</b>.
Each participant earned <b>40 points</b> for joining the event, kicking off the league in great style.

It was a cold but clear Saturday morning, no wind, no rain, perfect conditions for a true Cross Country race.

Well done to all our runners for showing up, putting in the effort, and setting the tone for an exciting season ahead!

<p>Special congratulations to the top three finishers:<br>
1st <strong>Pierce Geoghegan</strong> <br>
2nd <strong>Geoffrey Alexandre</strong> <br>
3rd <strong>Paddy Murphy</strong><br></p>


They now sit at the top of the Winter League standings, but with five races still to come, <strong>everyone has a real chance to climb the rankings</strong> and make a strong impact on the league.
