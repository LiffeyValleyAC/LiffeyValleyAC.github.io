🎉Congratulations to <b>Ruth Murphy</b> who is the winner of our Winter League🏆. Ruth had 3 points to spare over <b>Margaret O'Friel</b> and managed this even without a 10 point bonus for racing all 5 races. 

<i>The Winter League is an aggregation of the best 4 of 5 races in our series, which starts with the Cake Race in December and concludes with the 2 Mile Road Race in April. Those who finish all 5 races in the series are awarded a bonus of 10 points, while their worst scoring race is not counted. </i> 

Congratulations to <b>Margaret O'Friel</b> who finished second and <b>Cormac Long</b> who finished third, repeating the same result than last year.

Well done to all <b>60 athletes</b> who competed in at least one of our league races this year. 

A special thank you to all the coaches, athletes, and volunteers who made every race possible. From those recording times to those calculating results and capturing unforgettable moments into photos, your efforts are invaluable.
Your hard work, dedication, and determination have truly paid off.  📸🙌👏
