title: LVAC XC Championships - Winter League nro3 of 5
location: Phoenix Park, Dublin
---

Our <b>Club XC Championships</b> took place in the Phoenix Park. This was the <b>3rd out of 5</b> Winter League Races <br>
Women and M60+ ran 2 laps or 5km around the Dog Pond course while it was 7.5k or 3 laps for the Men.

The weather conditions were brutal, with relentless wind and heavy rain lashing the course. The challenging terrain was further tested by deep mud, making every step a battle for traction. It was a true test of endurance and grit.

Congratulations to all our athletes and as always a big thank you to the officials for making the race happen.
