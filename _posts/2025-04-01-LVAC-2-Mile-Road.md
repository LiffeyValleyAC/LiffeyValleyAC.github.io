Tonight we had our 2 mile handicap road race with 40 men and women competing - Joe Whittle was first home, with DeAngelo Massah and Ruth Murphy 2nd and 3rd respectively, followed by a swarm of Liffey Valley clubmates as the handicaps unwound on lap 2 of the Polo Grounds circuit. 

Well done everyone who raced, and thanks to everyone who helped make the race happen smoothly.
