Tonight we had our 2 mile handicap road race with <b>40</b> men and women competing - <b>Joe Whittle</b> was first home, with <b>DeAngelo Massah</b> and <b>Ruth Murphy</b> 2nd and 3rd respectively, followed by a swarm of Liffey Valley clubmates as the handicaps unwound on lap 2 of the Polo Grounds circuit. 

Well done everyone who raced, and thanks to everyone who helped make the race happen smoothly.
