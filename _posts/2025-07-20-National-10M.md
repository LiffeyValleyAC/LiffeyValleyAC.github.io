<p><strong>Thank you and congratulations to all Liffey Valley A.C. runners who took part in the Irish Runner 10 Mile at Phoenix Park on Sunday, July 20th, 2025.</strong></p>

<p>On what turned out to be a very wet and challenging morning, our athletes showed great resilience and determination throughout the race. Despite the persistent rain, there were standout performances and several runners managed to achieve new personal bests—a true testament to their preparation and focus.</p>

<p><strong>Paddy Murphy</strong> led the team home with an excellent time of <strong>59:35</strong>, placing 53rd overall—a strong performance under tough conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Mollie O'Donnell</strong> delivered another consistent run to finish in <strong>1:03:53</strong>, followed closely by <strong>Robert Collins</strong>, who ran a solid <strong>1:06:12</strong> in the M35 category.</p>
<p>Special mentions also go to:</p> 
<ul> <li><strong>Jen Preston</strong> and <strong>Cliodhna Tutty Bardon</strong> – both delivering strong finishes under heavy rain in the FS category.</li> <li><strong>Siobhan Nugent</strong> and <strong>Stephanie Hawkins</strong> – putting in determined efforts and continuing their consistent form.</li> <li><strong>Margaret O'Friel</strong> – who completed the race in <strong>1:29:59</strong>, representing the F60 category with great spirit.</li> </ul>

<p>It was encouraging to see continued improvement across the group, and the ability to perform under pressure bodes well for the rest of the season. </p>

<p><strong>Well done to everyone who braved the rain and represented the club with pride.</strong> Let’s keep the momentum going as we move forward to the next events in the calendar!</p>
