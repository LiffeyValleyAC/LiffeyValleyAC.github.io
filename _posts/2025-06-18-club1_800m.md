<p>We had a great turnout at the <strong>first</strong> of our <strong>three Club Track Races</strong> on <strong>Wednesday 18th June 2025</strong> at <strong>Tallaght Track</strong>, where athletes competed over <strong>800m</strong>. These races offer a fantastic opportunity for our <strong>new athletes</strong> to experience track racing for the first time, while pushing our <strong>seasoned athletes</strong> to chase <strong>new PBs</strong> and aim for <strong>medals</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Congratulations</strong> once again to all our <strong>athletes</strong>, <strong>coaches</strong>, and <strong>officials</strong> who made it a fantastic evening of racing!</p>

<p>If you missed out or want another chance to race, make sure to join us for the <strong>second event</strong> on <strong>Wednesday 9th July 2025</strong>, featuring the <strong>1500m</strong> and <strong>300m</strong>. This is a great chance to test yourself over different distances and keep building towards your season goals!</p>

<p>And donâ€™t forget to save the date for the <strong>third and final race</strong> on <strong>Wednesday 23rd July 2025</strong> with the iconic <strong>1 Mile</strong> event!</p>

<p><strong>All members are welcome!</strong> Whether you're chasing a PB, racing for fun, or just want to enjoy the atmosphere, come and be part of it!</p>
