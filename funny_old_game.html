    <h2>A Funny Old Game<br>
      <small>by Jim Davis</small>
    </h2>
    <p>A well known football manager once said that football was a "funny old game",
    but what would one say about running? My own interpretation is that it is a
    FORM OF MADNESS and it is often said there is no point in being mad unless you
    show it, otherwise people will think you are normal.</p>

    <p>What sport would ask such a diversification of people including Accountants,
    Bricklayers, Soldiers, Salesmen, Firemen, Window Cleaners and Plumbers all
    together, in the pursuit of their obsession - RUNNING..</p>

    <p>According to the Oxford Dictionary to run is to progress by advancing each foot
    alternatively, never having both feet on the ground at once, that's what it
    says, although I often feel on a bad day that I had both feet on the ground and
    I thought I was running.</p>

    <p>I first started running in the sixties mainly to get fit for football. Indeed
    running is a refuge for many failed footballers one of whom I know later became
    NATIONAL CROSS COUNTRY CHAMPION. Training in those days consisted of 7 miles on
    the grass on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday 6 miles on the road. There was no
    such thing as stretching before you went out or warming up. Out of the door of
    the clubhouse you went and it was a hard run all the way. Indeed newcomers
    would often be dropped after a mile or so and were left to fend for themselves
    for the rest of the run; so the drop out rate of newcomers was very
    high.Everyone ran in tennis shoes or Altar Boy slippers which cost about 10
    shillings, 50p just to convert it for the young fellows reading this (€0.63 -
    Ed.).</p>

    <p>My first introduction to speedwork was when a certain John O'Reilly brought a
    group from the clubhouse on the North Circular Road, out to Chapelizod, up
    Knockmaroon, along the Strawberry Beds to a point near the Strawberry Hall
    doing pickups on the way. I had my good tennis shoes on and awoke the following
    morning with two stiff legs. When Iwent to the club on the following Thursday
    the bould John told me "don't worry about the stiff legs Jem it will do you
    good". How many times have I heard that since?</p>

    <p>In the 70's every runner worthy of the name was training six to seven days a
    week. During the early 70's the National Cross Country Champion Donie Walsh
    claimed that Pollen Tablets helped achieve success. Every athlete that you met
    at races was taking them until some researcher found that Pollen tablets helped
    you put on weight, so everybody threw the tablets away and didn't see any
    decline in performance.</p>

    <p>During this period the bould Ron Hill (of running gear fame) declared that his
    success in the European Marathon was due to his carbohydrate diet which was
    world famous. This diet consisted of a twenty mile run 7 days before the race
    and then and only then eating proteins for the next 3 days before eating all
    the carbohydrates you could get over the last few days. Everybody was on the
    'diet' as it was called at the time with all sorts of versions of it according
    to each individual. Fellows ate full cream sponges in one day.  Others had
    several portions of chips the night before the race.</p>

    <p>If you ran well the diet worked. If you didn't you blamed the diet. Three years
    later Ron declared that he himself never stuck rigidly to the regime as it was
    too severe. I can tell you now there's many a former marathoner who would
    throttle the same Ron Hill if he could get his hands on him now.</p>

    <p>Runners are like gamblers, all looking at the Golden Schedule that will turn
    them into superstars before next Sunday's race. This is what drives everybody
    to go out on those cold and wet nights, to go to the club on Tuesday and
    Thursday - one part of you want to stay at home, the other half dreading what
    the coach has on the menu. Will it be intervals around the zoo, or the dreaded
    triangle session? How does the bugger (the coach) think up those sessions? He
    must be a descendant of Hitler he pushes us so hard. The session over and back
    in the club we all declare it was tough but a good session. We have a shower,
    take a slagging in out stride, slag back and come back again next week for the
    same dose.</p>

    <p>Yes, running is a crazy sport but a great one. What other sport would you rub
    shoulders with a National or even an Olympic Champion? Just think of it, lining
    up alongside those greats. OK, you may be going in the same direction as
    they're going, not actually racing shoulder to shoulder with them, but how many
    footballers you know have played on the same field as Ryan Giggs, Niall Quinn
    or Packie Bonner? Indeed the police would remove you if you were near them.</p>

    <p>It is said that running is good for the mind. Indeed, there's many a cold
    winters night as I finished a hard run, ten miles, and I rounded the dreaded
    triangle I dreamt I was leading an Olympic field, and afar a long Sunday run I
    felt I could break the 2 hour marathon. Yes we have all dreamed of such great
    deeds only to be brought back to earth in the following Sunday's race when you
    finished 85th place and ran well.</p>

    <p>At the recent World Championships, Liffey Valley's representative Nick Davis
    told me he noted all the African Athletes ran in wetsuits on their steady runs
    despite the heat, so maybe that's where we have been going wrong all these
    years. Excuse me while I go out and buy a good wetsuit.</p>

    <p>Yes, running is a funny old game.</p>
